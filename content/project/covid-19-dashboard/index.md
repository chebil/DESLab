In December 2019, an [acute respiratory disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019) that causes severe symptoms such as fever, pneumonia and cough has emerged in Wuhan, Mainland China. Caused by [SARS-CoV-2 virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2), this contagious disease (so-called COVID-19) has spread all over the world causing a pandemic with thousands of morbidities and mortalities. In early March 2020, the [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic) reached [Tunisia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_coronavirus_pandemic_in_Tunisia). Due to the harmful characteristics of the disease, the Tunisian government has decided several measures to control the transmission and the status of the infection in the country including mobility restrictions and restructuration of health systems.
