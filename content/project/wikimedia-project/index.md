summary: >-
  Nowadays, semantic resources have been proven as efficient to drive computer applications in a variety of domains, particularly healthcare. Semantic resources provide detailed knowledge about various aspects of medicine including diseases, drugs, genes, and proteins and they can consequently be used to retrieve, process, and represent clinical information including electronic health records and scholarly publications. These databases enable biomedical relation extraction, biomedical relation classification, biomedical data validation, biomedical data augmentation, and biomedical decision support. However, the implementation of such biomedical resources in the Global South, particularly in Africa, is still limited due to the lack of consistent funding and human capacities.
  

  **This project is coordinated by: DES-RU.**
  

  **Budget: 50.000 $ USD**


  **Collaborators:**

  - Ronin Institute, Germany

  - University of Virginia, USA

  - University of Pretoria, South Africa
