# What is Docker?
Docker is a platform for developers and sysadmins to develop, deploy, and run applications with containers. The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called containerization. Containers are not new, but their use for easily deploying applications is.

## Why Docker?
- **Flexible**: Even the most complex applications can be containerized.
- **Lightweight**: Containers leverage and share the host kernel.
- They do not require a new OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs.
