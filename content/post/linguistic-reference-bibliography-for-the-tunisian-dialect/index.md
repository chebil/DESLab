title: Linguistic reference bibliography for the Tunisian dialect
date: 2023-11-10T13:09:20.728Z
summary: Houcemeddine Turki presents the outcomes of the standardization of the
  Tunisian dialect, which are now available online. The work includes a
  reference linguistic bibliography for Tunisian, a standardized spelling for
  Tunisian in Arabic letters, a standardized spelling and a standardized
  morphology for Tunisian in Latin letters, and a standardized phonology of
  Tunisian. The project has required considerable multidisciplinary efforts and
  has been developed in collaboration with the Association Derja and Data
  Engineering and Semantics Lab (DESLab)

I have the honour to inform you that our work on the standardization of the Tunisian dialect is now available online ([link](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4587899)). Our efforts are based on the use of an evidence-based documentalist approach in order to propose a foundational history, grammar and spelling in Arabic and Latin letters. Although evidence-based research has not been as successful in linguistics as it has been in medicine, I am convinced that it is a valid approach to establishing economic language policies. I am certain that the scientific literature can be biased, as [Dr. Wissem Aribi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAADSBbpABGOH2eK3k0VAn08-DebFqFIvS3zo?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3B5RY7I6VnTOOuWnJyRSTYaA%3D%3D) discusses, and that the approach proposed by the Linguistic Atlas of Tunisia, which is based on large-scale observation, is more accurate. Nevertheless, such a linguistic study requires the work of at least twenty doctoral students and substantial funding. This problem unfortunately explains the blocking of the Linguistic Atlas of Tunisia project and, consequently, the standardization of Tunisian. This demonstrates the importance of our work, which establishes a standard for the transcription of Tunisian in literary works and advertising signs, as well as a phonology and morphology for a standardized edition of Tunisian that does not favor the Greater Tunis dialect to the detriment of other dialects of Tunisian.
