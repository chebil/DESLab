abstract: Semantic text annotations have been a key factor for supporting
  computer applications ranging from knowledge graph construction to biomedical
  question answering. In this systematic review, we provide an analysis of the
  data models that have been applied to semantic annotation projects for the
  scholarly publications available in the CORD-19 dataset, an open database of
  the full texts of scholarly publications about COVID-19. Based on Google
  Scholar and the screening of specific research venues, we retrieve seventeen
  publications on the topic mostly from the United States of America.
  Subsequently, we outline and explain the inline semantic annotation models
  currently applied on the full texts of biomedical scholarly publications.
  Then, we discuss the data models currently used with reference to semantic
  annotation projects on the CORD-19 dataset to provide interesting directions
  for the development of semantic annotation models and projects.
