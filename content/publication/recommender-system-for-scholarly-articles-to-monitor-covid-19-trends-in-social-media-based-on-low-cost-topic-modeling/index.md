abstract: During the last years, many computer systems have been developed to
  track and monitor COVID-19 social network interactions. However, these systems
  have been mainly based on robust probabilistic approaches like Latent
  Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In another context, health recommender systems
  have always been personalized to the needs of single users instead of regional
  communities. Such applications will not be useful in the context of a public
  health emergency such as COVID-19 where general insights about local
  populations are needed by health policy makers to solve critical issues in a
  timely basis. In this research paper, we propose to modify LDA by letting it
  be driven by knowledge resources and we demonstrate how we can apply our topic
  modeling method to local social network interactions about COVID-19 to
  generate precise topic clusters reflecting the social trends about the
  pandemic at a low cost. Then, we outline how terms in every topic cluster can
  be converted into a search query to generate scholarly publications from
  PubMed Central for adjusting COVID-19 trendy thoughts in a population.
