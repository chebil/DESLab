abstract: " The IoT-based applications have a set of complex requirements, such
  as a reliable network connection and handling data from multiple sources
  quickly and accurately. Therefore, combining a Fog environment with a Cloud
  environment can be beneficial for IoT-based applications, as it provides a
  distributed computing system that can handle large amounts of data in real
  time. However, the microservice provision to execute such applications with
  achieving a high Quality of Service (QoS) and low bandwidth communications.
  Thus, the container-based microservice scheduling problem in a hybrid Fog and
  Cloud environment is a complex issue that has yet to be fully solved. In this
  work, we first propose a container-based microservice scheduling model for a
  hybrid architecture. Our model is a multi-objective scheduler, named DRL4HFC,
  for Hybrid Fog/Cloud architecture. It is based on two Deep Reinforce Learning
  (DRL) agents. DRL-based agents learn the inherent properties of the various
  microservices, nodes, and environments to determine the appropriate placement
  of each microservice instance required to execute each task within the
  Business Process (BP). Our proposal aims to reduce the execution time, compute
  and network resource consumption, and resource occupancy rates of Fog/Cloud
  nodes. Second, we present a set of experiments in order to evaluate the
  effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of cost, quality, and time. The
  experimental results demonstrate that DRL4HFC achieves faster execution times,
  lower communication costs and better balanced resource loads."
