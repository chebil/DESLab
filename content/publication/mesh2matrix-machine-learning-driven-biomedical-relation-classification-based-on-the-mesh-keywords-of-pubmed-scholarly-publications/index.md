abstract: Biomedical relation classification has been significantly improved by
  the application of advanced machine learning techniques on the raw texts of
  scholarly publications. Despite this improvement, the reliance on large chunks
  of raw text makes these algorithms suffer in generalization, precision and
  reliability. However, the use of the distinctive characteristics of
  bibliographic metadata can prove effective in achieving a better performance
  for this challenging task. In this research paper, we introduce an approach
  for biomedical relation classification using the qualifiers of co-occurring
  Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). First of all, we introduce MeSH2Matrix, our
  dataset consisting of 46,469 biomedical relations curated from PubMed
  publications using our approach. Using MeSH2Matrix, we build and train three
  machine learning models (SVM, D-Model and C-Net) to evaluate the efficiency of
  our approach for biomedical relation classification. Our best model achieves
  an accuracy of 70.78% for 195 classes and 83.09% for five superclasses. Our
  results will hopefully shed light on developing better algorithms for
  biomedical ontology construction based on the MeSH keywords of PubMed
  publications. For reproducibility purposes, MeSH2Matrix as well as all our
  source codes are made publicly accessible at
