abstract: Beyond class imbalance and the sample size per class, this research
  paper studies the effect of knowledge-driven class generalization (KCG) on the
  accuracy of classical machine learning algorithms for mono-label
  classification. We apply our analysis on five classical machine learning
  models (Perception, Support Vectors, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, and
  Decision Tree) to classify a set of animal image files generated from
  Wikimedia Commons, a large-scale repository of free images. Thanks to our
  analysis, we found that the accuracy rates of mono-label classification
  models, mainly Support Vectors and K-nearest neighbors, are affected by KCG.
  The increasing or decreasing behavior of accuracy rates is driven by the
  settings of the classification categories and the generalization. The analysis
  of KCG should be useful to understand the limitations of classical
  machine-learning algorithms and to fuel debates about the improvement of
  classical models and supervised classification evaluation methods within the
  framework of Explainable Artificial Intelligence.
