abstract: In this research paper, we analyzed the scientific research dealing
  with Wikidata from its creation in 2012 until late 2022, as revealed by
  Scopus. We identified 945 relevant scholarly publications, mostly at
  conferences. This landscape is characterized by small groups of experts and
  Wikidata contributors from the Global North. The same applies to the funders
  of Wikidata research, which are mainly governmental institutions from the
  Global North. Further networking and outreach should be done for better
  diversity and inclusion inside the Wikidata research community. The analysis
  also finds an emphasis on research around computer science perspectives on the
  development of Wikidata. Most outputs are mainly focused on developing methods
  for the creation, enrichment, reuse, and evaluation of open knowledge graphs,
  particularly Wikidata. However, there is also a significant but narrower
  interest in application-oriented research about the use of Wikidata in digital
  humanities, biology, and healthcare.
