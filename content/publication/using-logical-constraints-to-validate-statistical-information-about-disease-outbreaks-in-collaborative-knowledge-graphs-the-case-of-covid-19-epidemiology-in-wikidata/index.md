abstract: Urgent global research demands real-time dissemination of precise
  data. Wikidata, a collaborative and openly licensed knowledge graph available
  in RDF format, provides an ideal forum for exchanging structured data that can
  be verified and consolidated using validation schemas and bot edits. In this
  research article, we catalog an automatable task set necessary to assess and
  validate the portion of Wikidata relating to the COVID-19 epidemiology. These
  tasks assess statistical data and are implemented in SPARQL, a query language
  for semantic databases. We demonstrate the efficiency of our methods for
  evaluating structured non-relational information on COVID-19 in Wikidata, and
  its applicability in collaborative ontologies and knowledge graphs more
  broadly. We show the advantages and limitations of our proposed approach by
  comparing it to the features of other methods for the validation of linked web
  data as revealed by previous research.
