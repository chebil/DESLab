abstract: "In the age of advanced information systems powering fast-paced
  knowledge economies that face global societal challenges, it is no longer
  adequate to express scholarly information - an essential resource for modern
  economies - primarily as article narratives in document form. Despite being a
  well-established tradition in scholarly communication, PDF-based text
  publishing is hindering scientific progress as it buries scholarly information
  into non-machine-readable formats. The key objective of SKG4EOSC is to improve
  science productivity through development and implementation of services for
  text and data conversion, and production, curation, and re-use of FAIR
  scholarly information. This will be achieved by (1) establishing the Open
  Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG, orkg.org), a service operated by the SKG4EOSC
  coordinator, as a Hub for access to FAIR scholarly information in the EOSC;
  (2) lifting to EOSC of numerous and heterogeneous domain-specific research
  infrastructures through the ORKG Hubâ€™s harmonized access facilities; and (3)
  leverage the Hub to support cross-disciplinary research and policy decisions
  addressing societal challenges. SKG4EOSC will pilot the devised approaches and
  technologies in four research domains: biodiversity crisis, precision
  oncology, circular processes, and human cooperation. With the aim to improve
  machine-based scholarly information use, SKG4EOSC addresses an important
  current and future need of researchers. It extends the application of the FAIR
  data principles to scholarly communication practices, hence a more
  comprehensive coverage of the entire research lifecycle. Through explicit,
  machine actionable provenance links between FAIR scholarly information,
  primary data and contextual entities, it will substantially contribute to
  reproducibility, validation and trust in science. The resulting advanced
  machine support will catalyse new discoveries in basic research and solutions
  in key application areas."
