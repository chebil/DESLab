abstract: In this research letter, we build upon recent studies about the
  sleeping beauties awakened by the COVID-19 pandemic. We prove that a peak of
  citations for sleeping beauties is associated with a sharp increase in the
  number of citations received by their references. This demonstrates the
  existence of a cascading activation of citation-based sleeping beauties.
