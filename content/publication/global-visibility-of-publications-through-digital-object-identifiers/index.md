abstract: This brief research report analyzes the availability of Digital Object
  Identifiers (DOIs) worldwide, highlighting the dominance of large publishing
  houses and the need for unique persistent identifiers to increase the
  visibility of publications from developing countries. The study reveals that a
  considerable amount of publications from developing countries are excluded
  from the global flow of scientific information due to the absence of DOIs,
  emphasizing the need for alternative publishing models. The authors suggest
  that the availability of DOIs should receive more attention in scholarly
  communication and scientometrics, contributing to a necessary debate on DOIs
  relevant for librarians, publishers, and scientometricians.
