abstract: So far, research evaluation has been very important as a means for
  deciding academic tenure, awarding research grants, tracking the evolution of
  scholarly institutions, and assessing doctoral students (King, 1987). However,
  this effort has been limited by the lack of findability and accessibility of
  bibliographic databases allowing such an assessment and the legal and
  financial burdens toward their reuse (Herther, 2009). By the Internet age,
  scholarly publications became issued online in an electronic format allowing
  the extraction of accurate bibliographic information from them (Borgman, 2008)
  as well as the tracking of their readership, download, sharing, and search
  patterns (Markscheffel, 2013). Online resources called bibliographic knowledge
  graphs have consequently appeared, providing free bibliographic data and usage
  statistics for scholarly publications (Markscheffel, 2013).
