  We have noticed that many scientists process scholarly publications with
  advanced neural network-driven machine learning techniques to extract semantic
  information as if they were an ordinary corpus of natural language texts. In
  this opinion article, we give more emphasis to the value of
  Bibliometric-Enhanced Information Retrieval as a major field in such a
  context. In fact, bibliographic metadata can be easily used to refine
  information retrieval results without depending too much on very advanced
  techniques. This will allow the development of knowledge graph construction
  and refinement algorithms that return high accuracy results with less effort.
