abstract: The prediction of heart failure survivors is a challenging task and
  helps medical professionals to make the right decisions about patients.
  Expertise and experience of medical professionals are required to care for
  heart failure patients. Machine Learning models can help with understanding
  symptoms of cardiac disease. However, manual feature engineering is
  challenging and requires expertise to select the appropriate technique. This
  study proposes a smart healthcare framework using the Internet-of-Things (IoT)
  and cloud technologies that improve heart failure patients’ survival
  prediction without considering manual feature engineering. The smart IoT-based
  framework monitors patients on the basis of real-time data and provides
  timely, effective, and quality healthcare services to heart failure patients.
  The proposed model also investigates deep learning models in classifying heart
  failure patients as alive or deceased. The framework employs IoT-based sensors
  to obtain signals and send them to the cloud web server for processing. These
  signals are further processed by deep learning models to determine the state
  of patients. Patients’ health records and processing results are shared with a
  medical professional who will provide emergency help if required. The dataset
  used in this study contains 13 features and was attained from the UCI
  repository known as Heart Failure Clinical Records. The experimental results
  revealed that the CNN model is superior to other deep learning and machine
  learning models with a 0.9289 accuracy value.
