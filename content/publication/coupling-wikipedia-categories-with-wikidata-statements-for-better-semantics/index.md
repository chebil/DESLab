abstract: In this position paper, we explain how the combination of Wikipedia
  Categories already in use for driving semantic applications with Wikidata
  statements related to the categories and their direct members is possible from
  a technical perspective thanks to the flexible data models of Wikipedia
  Categories and Wikidata statements and to the programmatic options provided by
  the Wikimedia Community. We also outline how such a combination can bring an
  added value to the development of Wikipedia Projects as well as to the
  enhancement of knowledge-based systems.
