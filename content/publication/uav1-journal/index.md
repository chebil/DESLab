abstract: The multiperiodic crowd tracking (MPCT) problem is an extension of the periodic crowd tracking (PCT) problem, recently addressed in the literature and solved using an iterative solver called PCTs solver. For a given crowded event, the MPCT consists of follow-up crowds, using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) during different periods in a life-cycle of an open crowded area (OCA). Our main motivation is to remedy an important limitation of the PCTs solver called “PCTs solver myopia” which is, in certain cases, unable to manage the fleet of UAVs to cover all the periods of a given OCA life-cycle during a crowded event. The behavior of crowds can be predicted using machine learning techniques. Based on this assumption, we proposed a new mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, called MILP-MPCT, to solve the MPCT. The MILP-MPCT was designed using linear programming technique to build two objective functions that minimize the total time and energy consumed by UAVs under a set of constraints related to the MPCT problem. In order to validate the MILP-MPCT, we simulated it using IBM-ILOG-CPLEX optimization framework. Thanks to the “clairvoyance” of the proposed MILP-MPCT model, experimental investigations show that the MILP-MPCT model provides strategic moves of UAVs between charging stations (CSs) and crowds to provide better solutions than those reported in the literature.
