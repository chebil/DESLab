abstract: Because of its versatility across various applications, Blockchain has
  emerged as a technology garnering significant interest. It has effectively
  addressed the challenge of transitioning from a low-trust, centralized ledger
  maintained by a single third-party to a high-trust, decentralized structure
  maintained by multiple entities, often referred to as validating nodes.
  Consequently, numerous blockchain systems have arisen for a multitude of
  purposes. Nevertheless, a considerable number of these blockchain systems are
  plagued by significant deficiencies concerning their performance and security.
  These issues have to be rectified before the realization of a widespread
  adoption. An essential element within any blockchain system is its
  foundational consensus algorithm, a crucial determinant of both its
  performance and security attributes. Consequently, to tackle the shortcomings
  observed in various blockchain systems, the hardware implementation of a
  series of established and innovative consensus algorithms was carried out as
  part of this work. This paper aims to compare and analyze the different
  consensus methods in blockchain, namely PoS (Proof of Stake), PoW (Proof of
  Work) and PoA (Proof of Authority) using VHDL (Very High-Speed Integrated
  Circuit Hardware Description Language). Each of these methods has unique
  characteristics that influence the validation of transactions and the addition
  of blocks to the blockchain. In this context, we aim to demonstrate the
  importance of optimizing consensus execution time via IPs (Intellectual
  Property) in VHDL. We also evaluate their impact on security, scalability and
  performance for IoT applications.
