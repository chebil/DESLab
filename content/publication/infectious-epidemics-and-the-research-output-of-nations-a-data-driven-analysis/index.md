abstract: During the last years, several infectious diseases have caused
  widespread nationwide epidemics that affected information seeking behaviours,
  people mobility, economics and research trends. Examples of these epidemics
  are 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in mainland China
  and Hong Kong, 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in Guinea and Sierra Leone, 2015–2016
  Zika epidemic in Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico and the recent COVID-19
  epidemic in China and other countries. In this research article, we
  investigate the effect of large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases on the
  research productivity and landscape of nations through the analysis of the
  research outputs of main countries affected by SARS, Zika and Ebola epidemics
  as returned by Web of Science Core Collection. Despite the mobility
  restrictions and the limitations of work conditions due to the epidemics, we
  surprisingly found that the research characteristics and productivity of the
  countries that have excellent or moderate research traditions and communities
  are not affected by infectious epidemics due to their robust long-term
  research structures and policy. Similarly, large-scale infectious outbreaks
  can even boost the research productivity of countries with limited research
  traditions thanks to international capacity building collaborations provided
  by organisations and associations from leading research countries.
