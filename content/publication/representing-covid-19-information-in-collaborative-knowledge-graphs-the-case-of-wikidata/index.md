  Information related to the COVID-19 pandemic ranges from biological to
  bibliographic, from geographical to genetic and beyond. The structure of the
  raw data is highly complex, so converting it to meaningful insight requires
  data curation, integration, extraction and visualization, the global
  crowdsourcing of which provides both additional challenges and opportunities.
  Wikidata is an interdisciplinary, multilingual, open collaborative knowledge
  base of more than 90 million entities connected by well over a billion
  relationships. It acts as a web-scale platform for broader computer-supported
  cooperative work and linked open data, since it can be written to and queried
  in multiple ways in near real time by specialists, automated tools and the
  public. The main query language, SPARQL, is a semantic language used to
  retrieve and process information from databases saved in Resource Description
  Framework (RDF) format.


  Here, we introduce four aspects of Wikidata that enable it to serve as a knowledge base for general information on the COVID-19 pandemic: its flexible data model, its multilingual features, its alignment to multiple external databases, and its multidisciplinary organization. The rich knowledge graph created for COVID-19 in Wikidata can be visualized, explored, and analyzed for purposes like decision support as well as educational and scholarly research.
