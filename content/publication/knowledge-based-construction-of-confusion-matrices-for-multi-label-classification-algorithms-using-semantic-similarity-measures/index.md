abstract: So far, multi-label classification algorithms have been evaluated
  using statistical methods that do not consider the semantics of the considered
  classes and that fully depend on abstract computations such as Bayesian
  Reasoning. Currently, there are several attempts to develop ontology-based
  methods for a better assessment of supervised classification algorithms. In
  this research paper, we define a novel approach that aligns expected labels
  with predicted labels in multi-label classification using ontology-driven
  feature-based semantic similarity measures and we use it to develop a method
  for creating precise confusion matrices for a more effective evaluation of
  multi-label classification algorithms.
