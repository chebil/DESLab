abstract: This study presents a comprehensive framework to enhance Wikidata as
  an open and collaborative knowledge graph by integrating Open Biological and
  Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) keywords from
  PubMed publications. The primary data sources include OBO ontologies and MeSH
  keywords, which were collected and classified using SPARQL queries for RDF
  knowledge graphs. The semantic alignment between OBO ontologies and Wikidata
  was evaluated, revealing significant gaps and distorted representations that
  necessitate both automated and manual interventions for improvement. We
  employed pointwise mutual information to extract biomedical relations among
  the 5000 most common MeSH keywords in PubMed, achieving an accuracy of 89.40 %
  for superclass-based classification and 75.32 % for relation type-based
  classification. Additionally, Integrated Gradients were utilized to refine the
  classification by removing irrelevant MeSH qualifiers, enhancing overall
  efficiency. The framework also explored the use of MeSH keywords to identify
  PubMed reviews supporting unsupported Wikidata relations, finding that 45.8 %
  of these relations were not present in PubMed, indicating potential
  inconsistencies in Wikidata. The contributions of this study include improved
  methodologies for enriching Wikidata with biomedical information, validated
  semantic alignments, and efficient classification processes. This work
  enhances the interoperability and multilingual capabilities of biomedical
  ontologies and demonstrates the critical role of MeSH keywords in verifying
  semantic relations, thereby contributing to the robustness and accuracy of
  collaborative biomedical knowledge graphs.
