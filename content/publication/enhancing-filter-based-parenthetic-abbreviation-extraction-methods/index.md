abstract: This letter discusses the limitations of the use of filters to enhance
  the accuracy of the extraction of parenthetic abbreviations from scholarly
  publications and proposes the usage of the parentheses level count algorithm
  to efficiently extract entities between parentheses from raw texts as well as
  of machine learning-based supervised classification techniques for the
  identification of biomedical abbreviations to significantly reduce the removal
  of acronyms including disallowed punctuations.
