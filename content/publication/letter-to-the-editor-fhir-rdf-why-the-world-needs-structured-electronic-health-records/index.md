abstract: This comment discusses the benefits of representing and reusing the
  information in Electronic Health Record databases as knowledge graphs in the
  RDF format based on the FHIR RDF specification. As a structured representation
  of clinical data, FHIR RDF-based electronic health records allow a simpler and
  more effective integration of biomedical information using semantic alignment,
  queries, interoperability, and federation to provide better support for health
  practice and research.
