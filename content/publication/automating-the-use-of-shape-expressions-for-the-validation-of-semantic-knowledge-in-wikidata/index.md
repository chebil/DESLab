abstract: In this position paper, we discuss the semantic alignment-based
  approach for automating the ShEx-based validation of Wikidata items as
  proposed by Wikimedia Deutschland in July 2023, and we propose an alternative
  method that automates the shape-based validation of Wikidata entities and
  statements based on the conversion of ShEx EntitySchemas into SPARQL queries
  that identify relevant entities. We explain the advantages and drawbacks of
  both methods to provide the community with a useful overview of the matter.
