abstract: This research presents a solution that combines deep learning-based
  image processing, blockchain technology, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to
  achieve smarter control and traceability in greenhouse operations within the
  agricultural sector. By integrating these technologies, the aim is to overcome
  challenges posed by climate change, plant growth, limited agricultural land,
  and water scarcity, while enhancing crop yields and ensuring efficient and
  secure operations. The proposed system automates image capture, measurement,
  storage, and monitoring of environmental parameters in greenhouses, utilizing
  highly accurate image processing techniques with a 98% success rate. The
  integration of blockchain technology establishes an immutable and transparent
  record of transactions and data points, thereby improving traceability across
  the agricultural supply chain. This comprehensive approach fosters
  accountability, transparency, and trust, empowering consumers to make
  well-informed decisions regarding the products they purchase. Ultimately, this
  research contributes to advancing efficient and sustainable agricultural
  practices.
