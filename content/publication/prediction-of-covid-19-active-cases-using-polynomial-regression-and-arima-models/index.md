abstract: The fast spread of Covid-19 or the novel Coronavirus in the world has
  influenced it and caused a huge number of deaths. This remains a disastrous
  warning to general wellbeing and will be set apart as probably the most
  dangerous pandemic in world history and one of the important health challenges
  that the world has ever faced. The public health policymakers need the
  dependable forecasting of the active cases of Covid-19 to plan the future
  medical facilities. In this work, Machine Learning has been used to forecast
  the number of active cases of Covid-19 in some countries and in the world
  using John Hopkins University’s data to track the outbreak, attached by
  Desktop and Web application using Tkinter and Flask, python’s frameworks for
  visualizing the data in the affected countries that gives an understandable
  form of the data powered by different types of charts and choropleth maps and
  predictions of active cases of Covid-19 which have brought suffering to people
  everywhere based on two Models (ARIMA and Polynomial Regression).
