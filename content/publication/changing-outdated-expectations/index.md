abstract: Scientists are expected to advance sequentially from PhD to postdoc to
  tenure-track faculty. This expectation benefits prestigious academic
  institutions, which can choose from many applicants, but marginalizes people
  who follow unconventional trajectories, such as transitions between academia,
  industry, and teaching. Hiring teams in academia and beyond should embrace
  diverse, nonlinear career paths. New PhDs may apply their skills in the
  innovation divisions of large companies, at industry-led think tanks, or as
  teaching faculty, and may later choose another path or return to research.
  These experiences deepen understanding and generate new ideas. Academia can
  improve inclusivity by encouraging innovation, reducing stigma around
  “alternative” careers, and empowering individuals to make career decisions
  that suit them.
