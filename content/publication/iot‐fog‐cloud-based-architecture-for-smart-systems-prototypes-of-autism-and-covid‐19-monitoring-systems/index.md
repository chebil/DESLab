abstract: Making resources closer to the user might facilitate the integration
  of new technologies such as edge, fog, cloud computing, and big data. However,
  this brings many challenges shall be overridden when distributing a real-time
  stream processing, executing multiapplication in a safe multitenant
  environment, and orchestrating and managing the services and resources into a
  hybrid fog/cloud federation. In this article, first, we propose a business
  process model and notation (BPMN) extension to enable the Internet of Things
  (IoT)-aware business process (BP) modeling. The proposed extension takes into
  consideration the heterogeneous IoT and non-IoT resources, resource
  capacities, quality of service constraints, and so forth. Second, we present a
  new IoT-fog-cloud based architecture, which (i) supports the distributed inter
  and intralayer communication as well as the real-time stream processing in
  order to treat immediately IoT data and improve the entire system reliability,
  (ii) enables the multiapplication execution within a multitenancy architecture
  using the single sign-on technique to guarantee the data integrity within a
  multitenancy environment, and (iii) relies on the orchestration and federation
  management services for deploying BP into the appropriate fog and/or cloud
  resources. Third, we model, by using the proposed BPMN 2.0 extension, smart
  autistic child and coronavirus disease 2019 monitoring systems. Then we
  propose the prototypes for these two smart systems in order to carry out a set
  of extensive experiments illustrating the efficiency and effectiveness of our
  work.
