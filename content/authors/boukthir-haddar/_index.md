My research activities are mainly focused on the design and development of resolution methods for optimization problems with a combinatorial aspect, namely: "Knapsack Problems KPs", "Traveling Repairman Problem TRP", "Bin Packing Problem BPP", " Large-scale Virtual Machine and data center Placement Problems in cloud computing", etc. These problems are often encountered in several areas. In addition to my interest in solving these problems, I also contribute to the improvement of universal methods that can be useful for the scientific community of combinatorial optimization. More precisely, I contribute to the design of new approximate hybrid methods combining heuristics and meta-heuristics.
