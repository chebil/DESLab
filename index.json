We apply our analysis on five classical machine learning models (Perception, Support Vectors, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, and Decision Tree) to classify a set of animal image files generated from Wikimedia Commons, a large-scale repository of free images. Thanks to our analysis, we found that the accuracy rates of mono-label classification models, mainly Support Vectors and K-nearest neighbors, are affected by KCG. The increasing or decreasing behavior of accuracy rates is driven by the settings of the classification categories and the generalization. The analysis of KCG should be useful to understand the limitations of classical machine-learning algorithms and to fuel debates about the improvement of classical models and supervised classification evaluation methods within the framework of Explainable Artificial Intelligence.","tags":["Mono-label classification","Class generalization","Evaluation","Classical machine learning","Knowledge-driven generalization","Explainable Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"How Knowledge-Driven Class Generalization Affects Classical Machine Learning Algorithms for Mono-label Supervised Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohamed Ben Aouicha","Mohamed Ali Hadj Taieb"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.    # Supplementary notes can be added here, including [code and math](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/). -- ","date":1643068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643068800,"objectID":"e742187ea36c14a88e5db8c319a32de4","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/journal-article1/","publishdate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article1/","section":"publication","summary":"Online users are typically involved in multiple online social networks simultaneously to enjoy a variety of social network services, thus bringing about the interconnection of online social networks via bridge users called anchor users. Anchor users can be beneficial to a wide range of social network analysis applications such as cross-domain system recommendation, cross-network information diffusion, and link prediction, taking anchor userâ€™s intra-network structural information along with its cross-network structural properties into consideration. Several studies have so far tried to learn low-dimensional representations of social users by capturing their network structures inside one social network but they have not fully leveraged their intra-network structures with their cross-network structures to boost the performance of the aforementioned analysis tasks. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning model to learn Overall low-dimensional Vector Representations for Anchor Users (OVRAU), from a multiplex heterogeneous social network by investigating the intra-network as well as the cross-network structural information. Unlike previous works, our proposed model considers the multi-network scenario to encode diverse network structures of anchor users. We propose two types of embeddings to capture the different structural information of an anchor user from multiple social networks a high-dimensional base embedding and a low-dimensional social edge embedding for each social network. In particular, we learn a function that generates social edge embeddings by sampling and aggregating structural features from an anchor userâ€™s neighborhood inside different social networks through one of three candidate aggregator functions namely mean, max-pooling and LSTM, with a self-attention mechanism. Link prediction is used as a downstream task to evaluate the effectiveness of the learned embeddings. Experiments were conducted on real-world social networks dataset, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model involving all the three variants can significantly outperform the existing network representation learning approaches when applied on the link prediction task and also achieve better performance over all compared baselines.","tags":["Cross-social networks analysis","Anchor users","Network representation learning","Graph neural networks","Link prediction"],"title":"Cross-network representation learning for anchor users on multiplex heterogeneous social network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Molka Rekik"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.    # Supplementary notes can be added here, including [code and math](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/). -- ","date":1636070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1636070400,"objectID":"966884cc0d8ac9e31fab966c4534e973","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/journal-article/","publishdate":"2021-11-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/","section":"publication","summary":"The COronaVIrus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unfortunately highly transmissible across the people. In order to detect and track the suspected COVID-19 infected people and consequently limit the pandemic spread, this paper entails a framework integrating the machine learning (ML), cloud, fog, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to propose a novel smart COVID-19 disease monitoring and prognosis system. The proposal leverages the IoT devices that collect streaming data from both medical (e.g., X-ray machine, lung ultrasound machine, etc.) and non-medical (e.g., bracelet, smartwatch, etc.) devices. Moreover, the proposed hybrid fog-cloud framework provides two kinds of federated ML as a service (federated MLaaS); (i) the distributed batch MLaaS that is implemented on the cloud environment for a long-term decision-making, and (ii) the distributed stream MLaaS, which is installed into a hybrid fog-cloud environment for a short-term decision-making. The stream MLaaS uses a shared federated prediction model stored into the cloud, whereas the real-time symptom data processing and COVID-19 prediction are done into the fog. The federated ML models are determined after evaluating a set of both batch and stream ML algorithms from the Python's libraries. The evaluation considers both the quantitative (i.e., performance in terms of accuracy, precision, root mean squared error, and F1 score) and qualitative (i.e., quality of service in terms of server latency, response time, and network latency) metrics to assess these algorithms. This evaluation shows that the stream ML algorithms have the potential to be integrated into the COVID-19 prognosis allowing the early predictions of the suspected COVID-19 cases.","tags":["COVID-19 pandemic","Machine learning","IoT devices","Batch/streaming data","Hybrid fog-cloud federation","Federated MLaaS","Real-time prediction","Decision-making","Quantitative and qualitative evaluation"],"title":"Hybrid-based framework for COVID-19 prediction via federated machine learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://deslab.org/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://deslab.org/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://deslab.org/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]
