We apply our analysis on five classical machine learning models (Perception, Support Vectors, Random Forest, K-nearest neighbors, and Decision Tree) to classify a set of animal image files generated from Wikimedia Commons, a large-scale repository of free images. Thanks to our analysis, we found that the accuracy rates of mono-label classification models, mainly Support Vectors and K-nearest neighbors, are affected by KCG. The increasing or decreasing behavior of accuracy rates is driven by the settings of the classification categories and the generalization. The analysis of KCG should be useful to understand the limitations of classical machine-learning algorithms and to fuel debates about the improvement of classical models and supervised classification evaluation methods within the framework of Explainable Artificial Intelligence.","tags":["Mono-label classification","Class generalization","Evaluation","Classical machine learning","Knowledge-driven generalization","Explainable Artificial Intelligence"],"title":"How Knowledge-Driven Class Generalization Affects Classical Machine Learning Algorithms for Mono-label Supervised Classification","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Walid Karamti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1647993407,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647993407,"objectID":"ca0be50c4f37a236a807228e894fb9d5","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/iot-based-smart-monitoring-of-patients-with-acute-heart-failure/","publishdate":"2022-03-22T23:56:47.136Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iot-based-smart-monitoring-of-patients-with-acute-heart-failure/","section":"publication","summary":"The prediction of heart failure survivors is a challenging task and helps medical professionals to make the right decisions about patients. Expertise and experience of medical professionals are required to care for heart failure patients. Machine Learning models can help with understanding symptoms of cardiac disease. However, manual feature engineering is challenging and requires expertise to select the appropriate technique. This study proposes a smart healthcare framework using the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and cloud technologies that improve heart failure patients’ survival prediction without considering manual feature engineering. The smart IoT-based framework monitors patients on the basis of real-time data and provides timely, effective, and quality healthcare services to heart failure patients. The proposed model also investigates deep learning models in classifying heart failure patients as alive or deceased. The framework employs IoT-based sensors to obtain signals and send them to the cloud web server for processing. These signals are further processed by deep learning models to determine the state of patients. Patients’ health records and processing results are shared with a medical professional who will provide emergency help if required. The dataset used in this study contains 13 features and was attained from the UCI repository known as Heart Failure Clinical Records. The experimental results revealed that the CNN model is superior to other deep learning and machine learning models with a 0.9289 accuracy value.","tags":["IoT","Smart healthcare","Patient's mortality prediction","Deep learning","Heart disease"],"title":"IoT Based Smart Monitoring of Patients with Acute Heart Failure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Houcemeddine Turki"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1647386895,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647386895,"objectID":"2a8beb80234f643819cd7d76d94ae76f","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/skg4eosc-scholarly-knowledge-graphs-for-eosc-establishing-a-backbone-of-knowledge-graphs-for-fair-scholarly-information-in-eosc/","publishdate":"2022-03-15T23:28:15.384Z","relpermalink":"/publication/skg4eosc-scholarly-knowledge-graphs-for-eosc-establishing-a-backbone-of-knowledge-graphs-for-fair-scholarly-information-in-eosc/","section":"publication","summary":"In the age of advanced information systems powering fast-paced knowledge economies that face global societal challenges, it is no longer adequate to express scholarly information - an essential resource for modern economies - primarily as article narratives in document form. Despite being a well-established tradition in scholarly communication, PDF-based text publishing is hindering scientific progress as it buries scholarly information into non-machine-readable formats. The key objective of SKG4EOSC is to improve science productivity through development and implementation of services for text and data conversion, and production, curation, and re-use of FAIR scholarly information. This will be achieved by (1) establishing the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG, orkg.org), a service operated by the SKG4EOSC coordinator, as a Hub for access to FAIR scholarly information in the EOSC; (2) lifting to EOSC of numerous and heterogeneous domain-specific research infrastructures through the ORKG Hub’s harmonized access facilities; and (3) leverage the Hub to support cross-disciplinary research and policy decisions addressing societal challenges. SKG4EOSC will pilot the devised approaches and technologies in four research domains: biodiversity crisis, precision oncology, circular processes, and human cooperation. With the aim to improve machine-based scholarly information use, SKG4EOSC addresses an important current and future need of researchers. It extends the application of the FAIR data principles to scholarly communication practices, hence a more comprehensive coverage of the entire research lifecycle. Through explicit, machine actionable provenance links between FAIR scholarly information, primary data and contextual entities, it will substantially contribute to reproducibility, validation and trust in science. The resulting advanced machine support will catalyse new discoveries in basic research and solutions in key application areas.","tags":["Scholarly literature","Scholarly information","Scholarly communication","Knowledge Graphs","FAIR","Information extraction"],"title":"SKG4EOSC - Scholarly Knowledge Graphs for EOSC: Establishing a backbone of knowledge graphs for FAIR Scholarly Information in EOSC","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Houcemeddine Turki","Mohamed Ali Hadj Taieb","Mohamed Ben Aouicha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1643929893,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643929893,"objectID":"1e2480151f931314f58b89e612c9af82","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/representing-covid-19-information-in-collaborative-knowledge-graphs-the-case-of-wikidata/","publishdate":"2022-02-03T23:11:33.936Z","relpermalink":"/publication/representing-covid-19-information-in-collaborative-knowledge-graphs-the-case-of-wikidata/","section":"publication","summary":"Information related to the COVID-19 pandemic ranges from biological to bibliographic, from geographical to genetic and beyond. The structure of the raw data is highly complex, so converting it to meaningful insight requires data curation, integration, extraction and visualization, the global crowdsourcing of which provides both additional challenges and opportunities. Wikidata is an interdisciplinary, multilingual, open collaborative knowledge base of more than 90 million entities connected by well over a billion relationships. It acts as a web-scale platform for broader computer-supported cooperative work and linked open data, since it can be written to and queried in multiple ways in near real time by specialists, automated tools and the public. The main query language, SPARQL, is a semantic language used to retrieve and process information from databases saved in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.\n\nHere, we introduce four aspects of Wikidata that enable it to serve as a knowledge base for general information on the COVID-19 pandemic: its flexible data model, its multilingual features, its alignment to multiple external databases, and its multidisciplinary organization. The rich knowledge graph created for COVID-19 in Wikidata can be visualized, explored, and analyzed for purposes like decision support as well as educational and scholarly research.","tags":null,"title":"Representing COVID-19 information in collaborative knowledge graphs: the case of Wikidata","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohamed Ali Hadj Taieb","Mohamed Ben Aouicha"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.    # Supplementary notes can be added here, including [code and math](https://wowchemy.com/docs/content/writing-markdown-latex/). -- ","date":1643068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643068800,"objectID":"e742187ea36c14a88e5db8c319a32de4","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/journal-article1/","publishdate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article1/","section":"publication","summary":"Online users are typically involved in multiple online social networks simultaneously to enjoy a variety of social network services, thus bringing about the interconnection of online social networks via bridge users called anchor users. Anchor users can be beneficial to a wide range of social network analysis applications such as cross-domain system recommendation, cross-network information diffusion, and link prediction, taking anchor user’s intra-network structural information along with its cross-network structural properties into consideration. Several studies have so far tried to learn low-dimensional representations of social users by capturing their network structures inside one social network but they have not fully leveraged their intra-network structures with their cross-network structures to boost the performance of the aforementioned analysis tasks. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning model to learn Overall low-dimensional Vector Representations for Anchor Users (OVRAU), from a multiplex heterogeneous social network by investigating the intra-network as well as the cross-network structural information. Unlike previous works, our proposed model considers the multi-network scenario to encode diverse network structures of anchor users. We propose two types of embeddings to capture the different structural information of an anchor user from multiple social networks a high-dimensional base embedding and a low-dimensional social edge embedding for each social network. In particular, we learn a function that generates social edge embeddings by sampling and aggregating structural features from an anchor user’s neighborhood inside different social networks through one of three candidate aggregator functions namely mean, max-pooling and LSTM, with a self-attention mechanism. Link prediction is used as a downstream task to evaluate the effectiveness of the learned embeddings. Experiments were conducted on real-world social networks dataset, and the results demonstrate that our proposed model involving all the three variants can significantly outperform the existing network representation learning approaches when applied on the link prediction task and also achieve better performance over all compared baselines.","tags":["Cross-social networks analysis","Anchor users","Network representation learning","Graph neural networks","Link prediction"],"title":"Cross-network representation learning for anchor users on multiplex heterogeneous social network","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Boulbaba Ben Ammar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1639246420,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639246420,"objectID":"b695a7f3aafee436e57f5bc5526055e9","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/prediction-of-covid-19-active-cases-using-polynomial-regression-and-arima-models/","publishdate":"2021-12-11T18:13:40.354Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prediction-of-covid-19-active-cases-using-polynomial-regression-and-arima-models/","section":"publication","summary":"The fast spread of Covid-19 or the novel Coronavirus in the world has influenced it and caused a huge number of deaths.

In order to detect and track the suspected COVID-19 infected people and consequently limit the pandemic spread, this paper entails a framework integrating the machine learning (ML), cloud, fog, and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies to propose a novel smart COVID-19 disease monitoring and prognosis system. The proposal leverages the IoT devices that collect streaming data from both medical (e.g., X-ray machine, lung ultrasound machine, etc.) and non-medical (e.g., bracelet, smartwatch, etc.) devices. Moreover, the proposed hybrid fog-cloud framework provides two kinds of federated ML as a service (federated MLaaS); (i) the distributed batch MLaaS that is implemented on the cloud environment for a long-term decision-making, and (ii) the distributed stream MLaaS, which is installed into a hybrid fog-cloud environment for a short-term decision-making. The stream MLaaS uses a shared federated prediction model stored into the cloud, whereas the real-time symptom data processing and COVID-19 prediction are done into the fog. The federated ML models are determined after evaluating a set of both batch and stream ML algorithms from the Python's libraries. The evaluation considers both the quantitative (i.e., performance in terms of accuracy, precision, root mean squared error, and F1 score) and qualitative (i.e., quality of service in terms of server latency, response time, and network latency) metrics to assess these algorithms. This evaluation shows that the stream ML algorithms have the potential to be integrated into the COVID-19 prognosis allowing the early predictions of the suspected COVID-19 cases.","tags":["COVID-19 pandemic","Machine learning","IoT devices","Batch/streaming data","Hybrid fog-cloud federation","Federated MLaaS","Real-time prediction","Decision-making","Quantitative and qualitative evaluation"],"title":"Hybrid-based framework for COVID-19 prediction via federated machine learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Houcemeddine Turki","Mohamed Ali Hadj Taieb","Mohamed Ben Aouicha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1629155321,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629155321,"objectID":"d712e664876e47dc758f6405a3f2af8f","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/knowledge-based-construction-of-confusion-matrices-for-multi-label-classification-algorithms-using-semantic-similarity-measures/","publishdate":"2021-08-16T23:08:41.648Z","relpermalink":"/publication/knowledge-based-construction-of-confusion-matrices-for-multi-label-classification-algorithms-using-semantic-similarity-measures/","section":"publication","summary":"So far, multi-label classification algorithms have been evaluated using statistical methods that do not consider the semantics of the considered classes and that fully depend on abstract computations such as Bayesian Reasoning.

Examples of these epidemics are 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in mainland China and Hong Kong, 2014–2016 Ebola epidemic in Guinea and Sierra Leone, 2015–2016 Zika epidemic in Brazil, Colombia and Puerto Rico and the recent COVID-19 epidemic in China and other countries. In this research article, we investigate the effect of large-scale outbreaks of infectious diseases on the research productivity and landscape of nations through the analysis of the research outputs of main countries affected by SARS, Zika and Ebola epidemics as returned by Web of Science Core Collection. Despite the mobility restrictions and the limitations of work conditions due to the epidemics, we surprisingly found that the research characteristics and productivity of the countries that have excellent or moderate research traditions and communities are not affected by infectious epidemics due to their robust long-term research structures and policy. Similarly, large-scale infectious outbreaks can even boost the research productivity of countries with limited research traditions thanks to international capacity building collaborations provided by organisations and associations from leading research countries.","tags":["Disease outbreak","epidemic","research productivity","scientometrics"],"title":"Infectious epidemics and the research output of nations: A data-driven analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Houcemeddine Turki","Mohamed Ali Hadj Taieb","Mohamed Ben Aouicha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608595796,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608595796,"objectID":"074b0b356aefd05f59d60848c177a449","permalink":"https://deslab.org/publication/enhancing-filter-based-parenthetic-abbreviation-extraction-methods/","publishdate":"2020-12-22T00:09:56.235Z","relpermalink":"/publication/enhancing-filter-based-parenthetic-abbreviation-extraction-methods/","section":"publication","summary":"This letter discusses the limitations of the use of filters to enhance the accuracy of the extraction of parenthetic abbreviations from scholarly publications and proposes the usage of the parentheses level count algorithm to efficiently extract entities between parentheses from raw texts as well as of machine learning-based supervised classification techniques for the identification of biomedical abbreviations to significantly reduce the removal of acronyms including disallowed punctuations.","tags":["data mining","information retrieval","acronym extraction","parenthetic acronym"],"title":"Enhancing filter-based parenthetic abbreviation extraction methods","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"https://deslab.org/contact/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://deslab.org/people/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b0d61e5cbb7472bf320bf0ef2aaeb977","permalink":"https://deslab.org/tour/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/tour/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Tour","type":"widget_page"}]
